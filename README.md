# clash

Cards (Ludicrous ones) Against Humanity (clash) is the ultimate irreverent party game where your wildest cards collide with humanityâ€™s darkest humor.

## TODO

- [ ] Add in index page more about this project and link to GitHub
- [ ] Fix bug when starting a game with selected decks which either don't have black or white cards
- [ ] Fix activated card sets not preserving state between additions
- [ ] Make touch/mobile friendly
  - [ ] The Hand (displaying all your cards)
  - [ ] Selecting the best card combo as czar
  - both need some preview functionality
